# KEOLA

The Keck Electronic Observing Log Archive (KEOLA) is a web based tool available inside the Keck network.  It monitors the data directories for each program during the night and reads the FITS headers of the files there and displays a table of metadata for each file.  The goal is to replace (for those observers who want it), the written logs one might typically take.

Observers can add comments to each file entry by scrolling to the right most column and entering their comment there.  They can also get timing info as to when sunset, twilight times, half time, etc. are on the logs page.

At the end of the run, the logs are saved to the PI's observer login page, so they have a copy for themselves.  This is the only way for observers to access these logs after the observing night.

For those with admin access (i.e. SAs), you can grab logs from any past run, so if an observer needs a copy for some reason you can bring them up and click the "Print/Save" button and send them the resulting file.
